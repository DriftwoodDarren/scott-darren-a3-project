# scott-darren-a3-project
A 2D Game created for Game Development Foundations Assignment 3

This project is not entirely completed with the main shooting and target collision mechanic currently not working.
So far that means the only thing you can do is move your "Tank" around using WASD for each cardinal direction. 

If I knew how to get the firing mechanic to work I would have you use Space to fire tank shells at the targets, hitting them would cause them to disappear. You would have to destroy all the targets before a time limit ran out.
